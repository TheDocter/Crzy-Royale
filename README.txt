# About
-------
Crzy Royale is a simple Battle Royale script users can use to have battles between each other. They will be able to loot
one item and ability to attack a different use who has joined the royale.

To start a Battle Royale event the Streamer (Caster) or a Mod of the channel needs to use !cr start.

Once the battle royale starts users will have the ability to use !cr loot and !cr attack {username}.

Each use can carry up to 1 item which will give them an added bonus. Users can only loot once.

When the user tries to attack a user and they are not in the battle royale they will get an error message saying that user
is not located in the match.

When the user tries to attack a user that is in the match the the script will compare items to see whose attack is better.
The user who has the higher attack will win. The loser will be knocked out and win x amount of currency.

The last person to be standing will win x amount currency multiplied by 2. This is a perk of the winner.

# Setup
-------
1. Install script via Stream Labs Chat bot.
2. Set the winning and losing currency to be given out when someone wins or dies. Default is 100 for losing and 500 for winning.
3. Tell your chat about the script.
